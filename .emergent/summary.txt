The previous AI engineer successfully built an AI-powered audit dashboard, progressively enhancing its features. Initially, a complete frontend MVP was developed with mock data, covering smart headers, intelligent sidebars, dashboard overview, document management, and simple analytics, all styled with Tailwind CSS and Recharts. Following user feedback, core components like , , , and  were significantly refined to meet detailed functional and UX requirements, still using mocks.

The project then moved to Phase 2, aiming for predictive and autonomous features, involving real-time infrastructure (Zustand, WebSockets), advanced charts, and intelligent automation. However, during this phase, the frontend encountered persistent heap limit memory errors, preventing successful screenshots and full verification. The latest instruction from the user pivoted the focus to an extremely detailed implementation of the Document Management page, which the AI engineer was actively working on, creating new, specific components and mock data for this section, and was about to take a screenshot to verify. The core challenge is the unresolved frontend memory issue.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was focused on a detailed re-implementation of the **Document Management page**. This was a pivot after encountering persistent frontend memory (heap limit) issues when trying to load the broader Phase 2 enhancements.

The current work involves:
1.  **Creation of **: A new, dedicated mock data file for the advanced document management features.
2.  **Development of new UI Components**:
    *   : A drag-and-drop area with mock AI classification preview, real-time file type detection, auto-categorization, and progress indicators for each file.
    *   : A horizontal progress visualization to show mocked AI processing stages (Upload, AI Scan, Extract, Analyze, Complete) with confidence meters and expandable stage details.
    *   : A component to display document previews with mocked AI insights, color-coded risk level indicators, and extracted metadata.
    *   : A panel to display mock AI-detected document gaps, audit phase context, and upload recommendations.
    *   : An updated version of the smart search bar, tailored for document management with natural language input and mock AI query suggestions.
3.  **Integration into **: The main  file has been updated to integrate all these newly created components, creating a comprehensive and intelligent document management interface.

The last action recorded was the AI engineer preparing to take a screenshot of the enhanced Document Management page to verify its appearance and functionality, after integrating these new components and restarting the frontend.
